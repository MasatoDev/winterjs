# WinterJS

A *blazing-fast* JavaScript server that runs Service Workers scripts according to the [Winter Community Group specification](https://wintercg.org/).

**WinterJS is able to handle up to 100,000 reqs/s in a single laptop** (see [Benchmark](./benchmark)).

> Note: WinterJS is not officially endorsed by WinterCG, despite sharing "Winter" in their name. There are many [runtimes supporting WinterCG](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/), WinterJS being one among those.

## Running WinterJS with Wasmer

The WinterJS server is published in Wasmer as [`wasmer/winterjs`](https://wasmer.io/wasmer/winterjs).

You can run the HTTP server locally with:

```shell
wasmer run wasmer/winterjs --net --mapdir=tests:tests tests/simple.js
```

Where `simple.js` is:

```js
addEventListener('fetch', (req) => {
  req.respondWith(new Response('hello'));
});
```

## Running WinterJS Natively

You can run WinterJS natively by simply doing

```shell
cargo run -- tests/simple.js
```

And then access the server in https://localhost:8080/

# How WasmerJS works

WinterJS is powered by [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/), [Spiderfire](https://github.com/Redfire75369/spiderfire) and [hyper](https://hyper.rs/)
to bring a new level of awesomeness to your Javascript apps.

WinterJS is using the [WASIX](https://wasix.org) standard to compile to WebAssembly. Please note that compiling to WASIX is currently a complex process. We recommend using precompiled versions from [`wasmer/winterjs`](https://wasmer.io/wasmer/winterjs), but please open an issue if you need to compile to WASIX locally.

# Limitations

WinterJS is early, pre-release software.
It is currently not fully compliant with the WinterCG spec and the runtime itself is still a work in progress.
It is not recommended to use WinterJS in production yet.
For more information, see the API Compatibility section below.

# WinterCG API Compatibility

This section will be updated as APIs are added/fixed.
If an API is missing from this section, that means that it is still not implemented.

The following words are used to describe the status of an API:

* ✅ Stable - The API is implemented and fully compliant with the spec. This does not account for potential undiscovered implementation errors in the native code.
* 🔶 Partial - The API is implemented but not fully compliant with the spec and/or there are known limitations.
* ❌ Pending - The API is not implemented yet.

|API|Status|Notes|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|`console`|✅ Stable|
|`fetch`|🔶 Partial|`Request` and `Response` need to be stabilized before `fetch` can be considered Stable
|`URL`|✅ Stable|
|`URLSearchParams`|✅ Stable|
|`Request`|🔶 Partial|`Request`s cannot be sent with `ReadableStream` bodies
|`Headers`|✅ Stable|
|`Response`|🔶 Partial|`Response.body` returns a Promise that resolves to a `ReadableStream` instead of returning a `ReadableStream` directly.<br/>`Response`s with `ReadableStream` bodies cannot be returned to native code.
|`Blob`|🔶 Partial|`Blob.stream()` is not implemented yet
|`File`|🔶 Partial|`Blob` must be stabilized before `File` can be considered stable
|`FormData`|✅ Stable|
|`TextDecoder`|✅ Stable|
|`TextDecoderStream`|✅ Stable|
|`TextEncoder`|✅ Stable|
|`TextEncoderStream`|🔶 Partial|Surrogate pairs spread across two chunks are not handled correctly
|`ReadableStream` and supporting types|✅ Stable|
|`WritableStream` and supporting types|✅ Stable|
|`TransformStream` and supporting types|🔶 Partial|Back-pressure is not implemented
|`atob`|✅ Stable|
|`btoa`|✅ Stable|
|`performance.now()`|✅ Stable|
|`performance.timeOrigin`|❌ Pending|
|`crypto`|✅ Stable|
|`crypto.subtle`|🔶 Partial|
